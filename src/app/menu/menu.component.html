              ForgotPW helps you keep different and secure passwords with
              every website while not sharing your full passwords with 
              anyone.  When you setup your password at any website you 
              can store a part of that password with ForgotPW which we can 
              send to you via SMS text message whenever you need it.  The 
              other part of the password should be something common you 
              remember in your head, the combination of which makes the 
              full password.  For example, say for Amazon.com you store 
              "happykittens" as your password part with ForgotPW, and 
              remember "11AA!!" which 
              you add to the end of all your passwords.  Your full password 
              for Amazon becomes "happykittens11AA!!".
              <br/>
              Choose your common password part carefully!  For this system
              to work this is not something you can frequently change.
              It is probably best to include all the characters
              which some websites require in passwords such as a capital
              letter, a number, and a special character.
