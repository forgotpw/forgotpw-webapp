        <h3 class="sub-heading">Is this safe?</h3>
        <p>We don't ask for your name, username, or real password.  We only only send SMS text
          messages upon request containing just the password hint requested, not
          the website it is for, or any other information.  Don't give us your
          real password, just a hint that only you will know.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Why don't I have to log in?</h3>
        <p>Your password hints are never displayed on the screen, the only way to
          extract them is by text message to your cell phone.  Likewise, to store
          a password hint you will have to confirm by text message to your phone
          that you originated the request.  This serves as a form of authentication
          instead of requiring yet one more password you're just going to forget.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Can I remove all my stored password hints?</h3>
        <p>Yes, click here to completely remove all data you have provided us.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Are SMS text messages secure?</h3>
        <p>SMS text messages, like email, are not inherently secure and can
          potentially be viewed in transit by sophisticated hackers.  Because of this
          it is important that you use hints to something only you would know
          rather than storing your actual passwords with this service.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">What is the pricing for using this service?</h3>
        <p>ForgotPW is currently a free service, though it will not likely
          free forever.  It costs money to offer this service and if you find
          value from it and would like to see it continue we need to cover
          our costs.  We have not yet worked out what kind of pricing model
          makes sense however the goal is to make the price so low that you
          would not think twice about paying it.
